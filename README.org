* Configuration Manager
  A Java library that parses configuration files and keeps the
  settings available for programs that need them.

** Configuration files
   Each configuration file is comprised of named sections in square
   brackets and each section of key-value pairs:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   [section 1]
   key1 = value1
   key2 = value2

   [section 2]
   key1 = value1
   key3 = value2
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Empty lines and lines starting with the character '#' are ignored.


** Requirements
   In order to compile the library you will need java 7 and a recent
   version of apache maven. It has been tested with IcedTea7 2.3.3 and
   apache maven 3.0.4
